## Object Centric Event Log analysis with LLM
This scripts were created as a part of my master's thesis. The purpose of the scripts are to query object centric event logs in natural language using LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and conduct deeper OCEL analysis. Methods are available to translate natural language queries to SQL queries using LLMs and run the SQL queries against OCEL database. The thesis is available [here](https://www.pads.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bfsqlm).

### Dataset
Details of the datasets used is available [here](https://www.ocel-standard.org/event-logs/overview/).
